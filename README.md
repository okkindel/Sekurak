# Computer Sercurity

Set of programs for my security lessons. Including:

- city bike stealing (only theoretically :v) (LIST_2)
- interception of packets and theft of sessions (LIST_3)
- breaking hashes and descripting (LIST_4)
- university e-mail phishing, apache benchmark, packet capture, etc (LIST_5)
- fake bank application, malicious extensions (LIST_6)
- secured fake bank application with admin panel (LIST_7)
- fake bank application with rest api, jwt and cert (LIST_8)

Each list should contain its own readme file (unfortunately in Polish).
Be secured.
